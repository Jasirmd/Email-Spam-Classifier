## ðŸ“– Introduction

This repository showcases a machine learning project that implements a spam/ham email classifier using supervised learning techniques. The project encompasses data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a basic deployment strategy.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Project

This project was motivated by the persistent issue of email spam, which severely impacts user productivity and security. By developing a robust spam classification model, we aim to enhance the effectiveness of email filtering systems.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

This project utilizes a dataset comprising a collection of emails labeled as spam or ham. The dataset includes features extracted from the emails, such as text content, subject lines, and sender information.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed dataset for machine learning model compatibility.
- **Model Development:** Trained multiple machine learning models to classify emails as spam or ham.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Deployment:** Implemented a simple web-based or command-line application for classifying new emails.

---

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented

Several machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- others

Each model's performance was compared based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

## ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

The models were evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of the predictions.
- **Precision:** Proportion of true positives among all positive predictions.
- **Recall:** Proportion of true positives identified correctly.
- **F1-score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
